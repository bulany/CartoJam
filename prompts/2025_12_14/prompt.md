Wow that three js visualisation looked quite nice.
What I loved most about it is the really smooth way the interaction worked on a mobile device and on a desktop.
I could really easily zoom and sort of rotate the rough points of the plotted departments.
Is this zoom and rotating behaviour an "out of the box" thing with three js?
What is it technically called? Like is this moving a virtual camera to get the zoom effect or is it moving a virtual object with the camera fixed?
The display is a lot "blockier" and "rough" compared to flat svg visualisations I have made with points of prefecture coordinates, why is this? Can three js be made to render smooth lines instead of these 'voxel' type points? Or would it be better to use a different tool like d3.js for this (but then one might lose that nice zoom and tilt interaction that I liked so much?)
Seeing this has made me think of a different visualisation idea. I have a memory of scene, maybe in the 1980s film "War Games" where there is a kind of old school display of a globe of the world. I would love to create something like that.
I guess the aesthetic I'm going for is a kind of "80s oscilloscope hologram" - a bit like the death star plans hologram in the original Star Wars. I want nice simple lines but lines that have a bit of a "fuzz" and glow to them like the lines you see on an analogue oscilloscope. 
And this is what I want the lines to show: just a simple vector outline of the coastlines of the globe of earth. It would be great if it could be just as easily rotated and zoomed as in that last demo you made... and of course it works well on the phone and desktop... this time its very simple there are no other controls it just comes up with the spinning globe that can then be moved by the user.
Again I would like all this to be just one page of html that I can easily put in the docs folder of my github repo so it will be published by github pages.
For a bonus, stretch goal it might be nice to have it so the screen first appears blank and then the continent outlines are "drawn" on to the globe (a bit like an oscilloscope trace), but if this is too complicated for this first iteration please don't worry about it. I guess I would kind of like to see how the code looks and see if I can understand it.
Or actually maybe for the special effect it would be better to have this: the screen starts blank and then its like a plane gets pulled back through the globe slowly making it visible: like first you only see the outlines on the equator and then this slice gets bigger and bigger until finally you see half the globe (a full circle outline)... but you see all the continent outlines because its slowly spinning.
