Ok this is what I would like to get to...
The attached one page app is starting to go in the right direction but this is where I want to get to today:
I would like to make the app as a PWA using Svelte. I'll probably need to be walked through setting that app.
At this stage I don't want to worry so much about the game/quiz aspect but I want to get the "reference" aspect working really well.
By "reference" I mean that the app provides a simple map with the outlines of departments and a contained list of all the names of the departments, the names of their "prefecture" and also the name of the region that the department can be found in.
There will be two parts to the current phase... one part is the app will open in a new instance with just the basic map that you can over over each department and as you hover over a department in the display on the side the department number appears (quite large), the name of the department underneath, its prefecture and its region. The visual display puts the highlighted department in a different colour, it also shows a dot where the prefecture is located within the department and also the outline of the region it belongs in is highlighted (maybe there is a light colour change associated with that too). In any case, as the user hovers over departments they can rapidly "browse" each department and find its number, name, prefecture and region.
If the user clicks on a department, the highlight "sticks" and then using the arrow keys the user can scroll numerically through each department... so say I click on department 01 Ain, then when I use the arrow keys after that, the 02 Ainse will be highlighted etc
Well lets just try and get this up and running before I go onto the next mode which will be interesting (generating an animation based on a sequence of departments).
