This is great - I love the react preview that you created... can you do two things for me?
1. Explain how you achieved the styling on the little demo I can see on the side here. Like its a very nice modern feel with whites, blues and greys, lovely sans serif fonts etc but looking at the code in the preview I can't really see any (maybe I see some class names that look at bit like tailwind)? Is this colour scheme and font choice the default for react? Can I just save this code as a certain file type and do a "live preview" in vscode and it will just work? Like what would I need to make it work on my own machine like the preview you have made for me.
2. Just a couple of slight changes in the UI: can we include the two departments of Corsica (2A and 2B) and have them in that order sandwiched in between departments 19 and 21? When clicking a department I think its great... then the arrow keys work perfectly, but it would be nice if the hover still kind of works as a temporary thing until the mouse goes out of the map area in which case the department 'snaps' back to the last one explicitly clicked or until an arrow key is pressed... so initially there is no department selected and the hover works as you had it, once the user clicks a department then that one is remembered as the selected department... they can still hover around and see the other numbers and names but if they press an arrow key or hover over an area that's not a department, the selection snaps back to the last clicked department - I hope that makes sense!

Ok this is really great... I think you really nailed the interaction part of it - great work! I haven't inspected the code in detail but I wonder how easy it will be to wrap my head around the basic flow of how this interaction model works.  Also I think it might be nice to add in that if a department is clicked and the user is hovering around browsing other departments then if they click in an area with no department then the state of the interaction goes back to the initial state (like how you have it when 'ESC' is pressed). 
Also and this is getting into more detail, I think this is looking great for a desktop interaction and layout but how is it going to work on a phone? What is the best practice way of doing things here? Like I imagine we'll have to have little arrow buttons that people can press on a phone to scroll through departments because there is no keyboard available.
Finally does the tailwind method of styling make it easy to change 'theme's' based on the browsers setting or is there a standard and easy of doing this? I notice in the little demo the styling looks great but i have my browser set to dark mode and the background of the demo page is bright white.

Ok this is looking really good... you know what I love? 
I love the fact that you didn't even have to use d3 but because of the coordinates of each of the prefectures, when they are plotted you can actually get an idea of the shape of France without having any complex data sets or drawing code. I really like that.
Things that are a bit funny: in the initial unselected department state, when you hover it can change the size of the info panel quite a lot because sometimes there is the department info and sometimes there is just the message... this causes a strobing of that panel size and as the layout switches back and forth very quickly. I wonder if the info panel size could be fixed a bit (even if its relative) so that this doesn't occur. 
Secondly... can you somehow give me a version of this that I can download and commit to my github repo and then explain how I can use git hub pages to set it up so I can send a link to friends and they can see have have a play with this demo on their phones?
