With the prefectures plotted like this (those coordinates are GPS?) what would you call or how would you describe the projection this creates?
Like if I understand correctly the GPS points are actually 3D, but here I'm seeing a kind of map that's 2D?
Does that mean the projection is automatically centered in the middle of France or how does that work? Would there be places that are kind of stretched out or shrunk?
Can you think of an easy way to illustrate the distortion this projection introduces... like maybe with a simple animation using three js?
